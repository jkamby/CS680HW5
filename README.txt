JOHNPAUL KAMBAZZA CS680 README HW5

I regret that I lost more than six(6) weeks trying to figure out ant (HW4)!

This has not only affected my delivery time for the solutions but also the quality of my solutions since they are now rushed (due to time pressure).

For future reference I wish to suggest a dedicated Teaching Assistant or tutor to help out students in my predicament.

Otherwise, I have very much enjoyed the course and learned a lot so quickly.

Even as I prepare to submit I am tempted to continue working on my solutions (to add something I've just learnt/discovered).

This course has significantly increased my universe of Java knowledge, which was just theoretical concepts at te beginnning. Now I familiar with Eclipse, ant and a several classes and interfaces from the Java standard library. Interestingly this is just the beginning of software engineering/development. I enthusiastically look forward to next semster when I get to put my new skills to use on the capstone project.
